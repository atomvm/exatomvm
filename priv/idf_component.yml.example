# IDF component manifest for AtomVM on ESP32.
#
# To use this file:
#   1. Uncomment the dependencies you need below.
#   2. Rename it:  mv idf_component.yml.example idf_component.yml
#   3. Rebuild:    mix atomvm.esp32.build ...
#
# Note: At least one dependency must be uncommented before renaming,
# otherwise the empty `dependencies:` key will cause a build error.
# comment the `dependencies:` for no dependencies
#
# This file is copied into the AtomVM source tree at:
#   <atomvm_path>/src/platforms/esp32/main/idf_component.yml
#
# Relative `path:` entries are resolved from that location.
#
#   Without Docker:
#     Paths are relative to <atomvm_path>/src/platforms/esp32/main/
#     e.g. path: ../../../../../my_nif
#     navigates up from main/ -> esp32/ -> platforms/ -> src/ -> AtomVM/ -> parent
#
#   With Docker (--use-docker):
#     Only the AtomVM repository is mounted in the container.
#     Local path dependencies outside the AtomVM tree are NOT accessible.
